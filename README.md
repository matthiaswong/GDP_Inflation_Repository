# GDP_Inflation_Repository
This is a case study analysing data from Singapore's GDP and Inflation rates over the past 10 years and seeing whether it fits into the theoritical economic ADAS model. 

Findings have shown the GDP and Inflation has generally increased in a linear relationship, therefore it fits the ADAS model portion where the GPL and Real Output is increasing proprotionally. 

However, there may be some problems with the findings, which is further highlighted in the RMD file, such as the desperate need to fi Singapore's long run aggregate supply problem.
